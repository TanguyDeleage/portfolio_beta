      <h1>Les 400 Coop</h1>
      <p>
        Les 400 Coop is a French cooperative located in Paris 11Ã¨me.
        Cooperators choose to give 3 hours of their personal time per month, to help the cooperation. In return they become cooperators and are able to do their groceries.
        The cooperative uses a website to inform people and to help members manage their time at the coop.

    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Rethink a user experience on a website, and improve the flow and the interface

  <div class="project-section-mono-content project-brown">
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Before becoming a cooperator, I found really difficult to find informations I was looking for, and even harder to know how to join the coop. I choose to work on their websites in order to help them attract people.
      Currently 400 Coop is loosing cooperators (less revenue, but also less people helping). The main website's goal should be communication. First to encourage potential future cooperators to register and then
      provide informations. Engagements must be clearly display and it must provides all the informations needed. In addition
      the future cooperator must understand the benefits he will receive.

      <h2>Discovery</h2>
      <p>
      My first action was to understand how their current website is build
      </p>
      <video height="350" style="border-radius: 1rem;" controls preload="auto">
        <source src="../assets/img/400coop - actual.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
      </video>
    </div>

    <div class="project-section-dual-content project-white">
      <p>
        My first analysis is that the home page is full of informations of different importances (timetables, documentations,
        link to register, how it works, historical facts).
        Some links and informations are displayed several times and in various formats.
        In my opinion it seems essential to work on a simpler flow that will help someone to register and get the informations
        he needs.
        I started this project really recently and I'm currently inside the discovery phase. I will soon update the
        informations.
