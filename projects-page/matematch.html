        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          We have 10 days to build our very first Progressive Web App (a mobile
          application accessible from the web). To accomplish this task we are 3, with a beginner level in application developement.

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Every year a lot of young internationals arrive in Nantes for their studies. Due to a lack of informations and opportunities a lot of them miss the chance to meet French people, practice the language or discover the local areas. They need a simpkle way to connect to French people.

        <h2>Discovery</h2>
        <p>In order to meet my potential future users, I wanted to meet them and understand their needs. Thanks to a previous work in a student association for Erasmus student and to my personal relation, I have been able to meet exchange students during interviews on how they experienced or are experiencing their stay in France. Here's what I learned :
          Even if they want to speak French, when the person is not an english speaker it can become <b>hard to communicate</b>
          It's really <b>hard for them to join a group of French people</b>
          They would sometimes needs a French buddy to help them in different tasks
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-section-dual-content project-almond">
        <p>
          On the other hand, I did some research about Nantes, and it's international culture :
          Nantes host more than <b>50 000 students</b> each year
          I discovered some events on Facebook named <b>"Caf√© des langues"</b> a place where you meet internationals to talk in another language
          There are some associations in Nantes that allows French students to <b>help internationals</b>
          My conclusion were than Nantes is a place where there are a lot of students that would love to meet and help internationals to discover the French culture, but they <b>struggle to meet</b>
          In order to solve this problem we choose to create Matematch

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>We started by creating a user journey that lead us to the creation of our first user flow. </p>

        <p>With the user flow, we have been able to build our very first wireframe, that later evolved to a mockup.</p>

        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>
          With the design and the user flow done, we were able to buil our database schema, that will allow us to build our
          database, a necessary step to build the app. Few days later our simple user flow became a progressive app I was able
          to use on phone.

      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Today Matematch is a working Progressive Web App, we are still working on it to add some features before releasing it.
        However, this challenge was a great experience that taught us the different steps during the creation of a product, and how to deal wih it as a team and in a short time.
        On a personal aspect, it allows me to discover that I want to continue my path in Product Design.
