        <h1>Les 400 Coop</h1>
        <div>
          <p>
            Les 400 Coop is a French cooperative located in Paris 11. Cooperators choose to work their 3h a month to be able to do their groceries their. The cooperative uses a website to inform and to help members to manage their obligations.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="project-section challenge">
        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p> Currently 400 Coop is loosing cooperators (less revenue, but also less people helping), it needs to attract new people. As a cooperator I choose to help them attract new people by working on the design of their websites.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-section pitch">
        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <p>
          The main website's goal should be communication. First to encourage potential future cooperators to register and then provide informations. Engagements must be clearly display and it must provides all the informations needed. In addition the future cooperator must understand the benefits it will receive.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-section discovery">
        <h2>Discovery</h2>
        <p>My first action was to understand how their current website is build </p>
        <video height="450" style="border-radius: 1rem;" controls preload="auto">
          <source src="/Photos/400coop - actual.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
        <p>
          My first analysis is that the home page is full of informations of different importances (timetables, documentations, link to register, how it works, historical facts).
          Some links and informations are displayed several times and in various formats.
          In my opinion it seems essential to work on a simpler flow that will help someone to register and get the informations he needs.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        I started this project really recently and I'm currently inside the discovery phase. I will soon update the informations.
